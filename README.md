# Next Word Predictions Project

This project is designed to predict the next word in a sentence using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. It leverages sequence modeling and language generation models to provide accurate predictions based on the given text input.

## Features
- Predicts the next word based on user input.
- Utilizes pre-trained language models and embeddings.
- Interactive user interface for testing predictions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.0 or higher.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishSharma1810/WordPred.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd WordPred
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This will launch the application for generating next-word predictions.

2. **Interactive Mode:**
   Enter your text in the input box, and the system will predict the next possible word.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following key libraries and frameworks:
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and running the language models.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Flask or Streamlit: For creating the interactive interface.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset
The project is trained on the "Shakespeare-Hamlet.txt" corpus.
